    "##### **🔍 Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **FBI Time Series Analysis** project aims to analyze historical crime data and build predictive models to forecast future crime trends. The dataset includes various crime types recorded over time, along with their locations, timestamps, and other relevant features. By leveraging time series analysis techniques, the project seeks to identify patterns and seasonal trends, providing valuable insights for law enforcement agencies to enhance crime prevention strategies.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **📌 Dataset Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comprises multiple columns, capturing key attributes related to crimes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TYPE –** The category of crime (e.g., Theft, Break and Enter, Mischief).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HUNDRED_BLOCK –** The approximate location where the crime occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NEIGHBOURHOOD –** The neighborhood in which the incident took place.\n",

    "\n",
    "**📌 Moving Averages & Smoothing –** Identifying overall trends using statistical smoothing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 Machine Learning Models –** Applying models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Facebook Prophet for predictive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**📌 Deep Learning Approaches –** Exploring LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to capture complex temporal dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **📊 Expected Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 Accurate Crime Forecasts –** Provide law enforcement with actionable insights to allocate resources effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 Crime Heatmaps –** Visualizing high-risk areas to improve city surveillance strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 Policy Recommendations –** Helping city officials implement policies to curb rising crime rates based on data-driven insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **🚀 Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project holds significant potential for enhancing crime prevention strategies. By leveraging advanced forecasting techniques, law enforcement agencies can make data-driven decisions to reduce crime rates and improve public safety. 📉🔍\n",

    "#\n",
    "##### **📌 Key Problem Areas**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **📆 Temporal Crime Patterns –** Crimes follow specific trends based on time, but law enforcement lacks precise forecasting tools to predict peak periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🌍 Geospatial Crime Hotspots –** Certain areas experience repeated criminal activities, but identifying evolving hotspots remains a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🕒 Resource Allocation Inefficiencies –** Without predictive insights, police departments struggle with optimizing patrol deployment and emergency responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **📉 Lack of Crime Trend Forecasting –** Existing crime reports focus on past incidents, but future crime prediction remains underutilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🛠️ Need for Advanced Analytical Models –** Traditional statistical methods fall short in capturing complex crime patterns, necessitating machine learning and time series models.\n",
