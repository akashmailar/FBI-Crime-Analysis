### 👤 Contribution: Individual

#
## 📖 Project Summary

This project conducts an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Time Series Analysis** on ***FBI*** crime data from 1999 to 2011. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to crimes reported over time. The analysis is performed using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for data preprocessing and statistical exploration, while **Power BI** dashboard offers an interactive interface to explore crime distribution across different factors such as **time of day, day of the week, neighborhood, and crime type**.
